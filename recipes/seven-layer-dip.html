  <h2>About seven layer dip</h2>
  <p>
    My mom's 7-layer dip is a big hit at all small gatherings! 
    Refried beans are layered with guacamole, taco-seasoned sour cream, veggies, and 
    cheese; it's perfect for dipping tortilla chips. The dip traditionally takes less 
    time to disappear into bellies than it does to prepare.
